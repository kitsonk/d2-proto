# d2-proto

This is a prototype of some modules that might be considered for Dojo 2.0.  This is a working repository of highly
*experimental* code.  It is not intended for production use, nor does it indicate or imply any final APIs or direction
of Dojo 2.0.  Things will change and move around!  *Use at your own risk.*

## Modules

The following modules are of interest in this repository:

* [d2-proto/parser](blob/master/parser.js) - A "modern" version of the ``dojo/parser``.  It is intended to only support
  ES5 compliant user agents.  A demonstration test can be found [here](blob/master/test/parser.html).

## Requirements

``d2-proto`` currently depends upon:

* [dojo](/dojo/dojo) 1.8+
* [dojo2-teststack](/csnover/dojo2-teststack) - for unit testing

## Documentation

Experimental documentation is available [here](blob/master/docs/index.md).
